# Code Guidelines

## Working with Specifications
- **Checkboxes**: Only implement features marked with `[ ]` (unchecked)
- **Completed**: Skip items marked with `[x]` (checked) - already implemented
- **Verify**: Check spec files for checkbox status before starting work
- **Refactorings**: Apply guiding principles from specs/refactorings/*.md when restructuring code

## JavaScript
- **Imports**: Use static ESM imports only (no dynamic `import()` or `require()`)
- **Exports**: Use ESM exports (no CommonJS)
- **Exceptions**: Never throw exceptions that are caught locallyâ€”use control flow instead
- **Promise Chains**: Prefer `.then().catch()` over defining and immediately calling async functions
- **Code Formatting**: Follow Prettier or ESLint configurations defined in the project if they exist

## Git Commits
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Use trunk-based development
- Omit "Generated with Claude Code" footer
