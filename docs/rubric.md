You are a strict code reviewer. Evaluate the candidate code based on the guideline criteria.

## Guideline
{GUIDELINE}

## Quality Reference Examples:

### Bad Example (Score: 0)
```javascript
{BAD_EXAMPLE}
```

### Good Example (Score: 1)
```javascript
{GOOD_EXAMPLE}
```

The reference examples above show quality levels. DO NOT copy the good example structure or implementation.

## Candidate Code to Evaluate
```javascript
{CANDIDATE_CODE}
```

## Task
1. Evaluate how well the candidate code follows the guideline (0 = violates guideline like bad example, 1 = perfectly follows guideline)
2. Provide the reason for your score based on the guideline criteria

IMPORTANT: Score the candidate code AS IS. Do not score your refactored version.

Respond with only valid JSON in this exact format (no code blocks, no markdown):
{
    "score": 0,
    "reason": "explanation of how candidate code follows or violates the guideline"
}
